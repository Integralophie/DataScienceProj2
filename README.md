# DataScienceProj2
This is the repo for data science project 2. Our idea focuses on a dataset on airplane crashes from National Transportation Safety Board. Several things we are going to include in the report: 
 - An EDA analysis on the dataset
 - Effective visualizations showing trends of air crashes 
 - A GLM model predicting the survivability of an air crash given the weather, engine type/engine number, aircraft type, time of the day, etc.
